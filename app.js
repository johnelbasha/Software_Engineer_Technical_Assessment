  Your goal is to write a function that determines from someone's ${accountBalanceHistory} üßæ (see the array above for an example)

  Type üÖ∞ denotes a balance history where the balance amount decreases by varying amounts each month.

  Type üÖ± is one where the balance amount changes by the same amount each month.

  // Write your logic here  - No pressure üòÅ //
  let result;

        // 2.1.1 access the key called 'account', the value is an object
        // 2.1.2 within this object, access the key 'balance', the value is an object
        // 2.1.3 within this object, access the key 'amount', the value is an integer/number
        // 2.1.4 take this value and append closingBalances
// Step 3: now we have an array with three entries we can do an if statement as follows
    // 3.1 if the difference between the first and second numbers is the same as the difference between the second and third,
        // 3.1.a return 'B'
        // 3.1.b otherwise return 'A'
